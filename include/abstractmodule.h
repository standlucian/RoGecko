/*! Base class for data acquisition modules.
 *  This class is used by all modules that receive data from VME modules.
 *  All daq modules feature an output plugin that provides output PluginConnectors
 *  for plugins to connect to. All modules are polled by the RunThread using the #dataReady and #acquire methods.
 *  They should retrieve new data from their VME module and pass it back to the runthread using the supplied Event object.
 *  This is done by calling Event::put with the EventSlot object the data belongs to. The PluginThread will make the data
 *  available on the output connectors of the output plugin.
 *
 *  All daq modules communicate via an interface and have the VME base address of their VME module.
 *  To build a new module please inherit from BaseModule, which already provides some methods.
