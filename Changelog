5 September 2016
*Fixing acquisition hanging problem
**Added variable lastAcqPoll to store the poll number of the last successfull acquisition
**Added check to see if there are more than 1 million polls with no successfull acquisition
**If more than 1 million polls without successfull acquisition, panic resets all the modules
**Added panicReset function the MADC-32, MTDC-32 and Caen792 modules;
**Added temporary "I saved you" message when the RunThread calls the panicReset functions
**Running panic test #1
**Panic test #1, acquisition stopped, no reset
**Running panic test #2
**Panic test #2 successfull! Acquisition stopped, reset worked perfectly.
**Lowering number of unsuccessful acquisition polls until reset to 100,000.
**Changing text from "I saved you" to "Acquisition blocked. Auto-reset."
**Running panic test #3
**Successfully passed test. The acquisition blocked and reseted multiple times, continuint to run well. To be investigated if it affects the written data.

*First stable version established. This will be the main branch

6 September 2016
*Added a new variable, lastResetPoll, to make sure that, when the acquisition is blocked, only one reset command is issued.
**Running panic test #4
**Test successfull. Commited to Trunk

*Moved all header files to the "Include" folder
**Commited to Trunk

*Added "Return" to the Panic resets

*Setting up new branch, which will eventually lead to the implementation of multi event modes and buffer reads
**Eliminating all data processing from the MTDC-32 module DMX. Only raw data will emerge from the module.

7 September 2016
*Creating new plugin MTDC32Processor to take over the functions removed from the DMX
**Creating a way for the new plugin to read the settings of the module it is connected to

9 September 2016
*Settings can now be transferred to the plugin from the module
*Making routines to be able to read the settings
*Reading settings successful!
*Transferring processing routines to the plugin!

13 September 2016
*Because only one settings is needed from the module, the getSettings function will  be changed to int and will only return the data length format

14 September 2015
*New version is stable, commiting to trunk!
*Started work on making the program multi event mode friendly!
*Vector alocations have been modified to match the maximal size of the buffer, not the number of channels

15 September 2016
*Made sure the MultipleHistogramPlots ignores the event timestamp which is being sent with the event
*Changed the update interval of the MultipleHistogramPlugin to be a multiple of seconds, not of hundreds of miliseconds
*Renaming msecsToTimeout in MultipleHistogramPlugin to secsToTimeout
*Renaming halfSecondTimer in MultipleHistogramPlugin to secondTimer
*Adapting the eventbuilderBIGplugin to be able to handle buffer mode
*Removing useless input_has_data vector
*Removing useless total_data_length value
*Removing useless data_length vector
*Removing useless nofEnabledInputs value

12 October 2016
*Long break in completing this Changelog. Many changes in the meantime, Gecko entered service with success.
*Removing the "EventBuilderBIG: File is not open for writing." message. The message is superfluous now, it appeared when a Cache would be written when the file was being changed.

13 October 2016
*Solved problem where going over run number 128 would shift the whole file by 1 byte. 
*Clear histogram button now works properly
*Removed useless "Axes for" option in right-click plot2d menu

17 October 2016
*Trying to filter the Calibrated plot data so that only energies that come with a time signal are plotted
*Solved problem where changing the Histogram update time would lead to milisecond updates
*First stage of filter done
*Trying to filter the Calibrated plot data to remove values concurent with BGO data
*Second stage of filter done
*Some filter bugs squashed
*Moved Run Name and Reset Time input signals to their own slots. This clears up a problem with some changes not sticking when reopening an .ini file.

20 October 2016
*Implementing same-zoom for all
*Implemented same-zoom for alike spectra blocks
*Implementing unzoom for all for alike spectra blocks
*Fixed setting saving and loading problems
*Fixed log zoom
*Fixed writeToFile having a MB as 1024*1024 bytes

21 October 2016
*Changed the zoom selection area from a fixed pixel value to a percentage of the width/height of the plot
*Changed values to 15% of the height and 5% of the width.
*Separating autoscale into its own routine
*Added autoscale to the Same Zoom for All routine
*Fixed all warnings that appeared during compiling
*Fixing warnings messed up the SameZoom signals. Corrected

22 October 2016
*Changed the autoreset feature. Eliminated the counting from the previous reset. Now it waits for 30.000.000 ticks from the last acquisition or the last reset
*Fixed bug where Same zoom for all for filtered time would not work, but would zoom on the energies

23 October 2016
*Fixed problem with the Run header, which had the last 4 digits uninitialized.

26 October 2016
*Fixed problem where using the Same Zoom for all function in logarithmic when having a plot with no data in the file would cause an interface crash

27 October 2016
*Adding second LaBr time option to the MultipleCacheHistogram
*Done
*Making the autologbook
*Done for now
*Modified the way the calibrations are read and used, so as to accomodate for non-calibrated detectors
*Further fine-tuning and bug squashing

3 November 2016
*Removed all the interface of the Fanout plugins, due to it being useless and needlessly redundant
*Added a new folder, doc, for documentation
*Added the manuals of the MADC 32, MTDC 32, SIS1100/3100, Caen 792 and Caen 775 to the doc folder
*Started creating a Gecko manual, which can be found in the doc folder
*Added info about the Fanout and Int->Double plugins

8 November 2016
*Calculated number of triggers
*Propagated number of triggers and event rates to the RunManager, ScopeMainWindow and MultipleCacheHistogram
*Cleaned up the interface of the FanoutPlugins and InttoDouble

18 November 2016
*Fixed problem with logbook where it wouldn't properly change folder when the write path was changed.

22 November 2016
*Added comments to the InttoDouble, Fanout and Processor plugins
*Cleaned up the InttoDouble, Fanout and Processor plugins

7 March 2017
*Added a new histogram panel for long range energies for HPGes.
*Added back the pulsing functionality after a roll-back

8 March 2017
*Removed the network capabilites from the EventBuilderBig Plugin
*Removed Output connector from the EventBuilderBig Plugin

13 March 2017
*Finished rearranging and cleaning up the EventBuilderBig Plugin
*Finished writing the EventBuilderBig Plugin section in the manual

31 March 2017
*Added time limit on the logbook writing of the pulsing changes. Now it will only be written if at least 10 minutes have elapsed.
*Added capability to stop the Pulsing entirely.
