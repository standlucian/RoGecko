Prerequisites

GECKO needs a 2.6.x kernel to function. Older kernels are not supported.
Find out your current kernel version using: uname -a

GECKO depends on the following libraries:

* libgsl
* libqt4
* lib_sis3100
* libusb-dev
* qt4-qmake
* libboost-filesystem-dev
* gcc, gfortran and g++


libgsl and the Qt4 libraries can usually be installed from the package repositories
of your linux distribution.

lib_sis3100 can be compiled from source from the svn repository.
To do this change into the directory:

cd svn/taggersoftware/trunk/sisdev/sis3100_calls

And make the library with:

make clean
make
---

Compiling GECKO

cd svn/taggersoftware/trunk/sisdev/gecko
